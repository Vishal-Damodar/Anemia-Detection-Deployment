# Anemia Project

## Introduction

This project consists of two parts: a backend server located in the `/Anemia-backEnd` directory and a frontend application located in the `/Anemia-frontEnd` directory. The backend is responsible for handling data and business logic, while the frontend provides the user interface.

## Installation

### Backend Setup:

1. Navigate to the `/Anemia-backEnd` directory.
2. Open a terminal in this directory by using `shift` + right-click and selecting "Open PowerShell window here" or "Open Command Prompt window here", depending on your operating system.
3. Execute `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

### Frontend Setup:

1. Navigate to the `/Anemia-frontEnd` directory.
2. Open a terminal in this directory.
3. Execute `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the required frontend dependencies.

## Execution

Once the installation is complete, follow these steps to execute the project:

### Start the Backend Server:
